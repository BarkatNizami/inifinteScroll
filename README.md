# inifinteScroll

This is a project which creates an infinite scroll effect.

It uses images from Unsplash API(demo tier) and lazy loads new images at the end of the page once the scrollbar scrolls towards the end of the displayed data set.

The number of requests per hour is 50, hence, if the project seems to stop working, it's most likely because maximum number of requests is reached.
