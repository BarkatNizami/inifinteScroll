# inifinteScroll

This is a project which creates an infinite scroll effect.

It images from Unsplash API (free tier) and renders new images once the scrollbar nears the end of array.

The number of requests per hour is 50, hence, if the project seems to stop working, it's most likely due to maximum number of requests is reached.
